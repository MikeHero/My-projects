Web Application for Reporting Urban Problems
You can watch a demo of the project here: https://streamable.com/8dnitj

  The purpose of this work was to build a full-stack application. 
The backend is written in C#, the frontend is Angular. After a user 
logs in, he can post a photo along a description and the location
to help identify an urban problem or vote on other reports.
